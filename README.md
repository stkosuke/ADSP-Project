## Instruction from syllubus
### Deadline
Project Presentations & Deliverables are due on **5.21** (before the 10th in-person class).
### R codes
a. Get the data and import it into a notebook
b. Transform, clean, and prepare the data for analysis
c. Analyze the data to answer your questions fully. Your analysis should include viewing the data graphically
d. Build models to analyze your data. You may report the model accuracy results, but thatâ€™s not the focus of the project
e. Make your code readable by adding comments
### Presentation
When preparing for your project presentation, please discuss your entire project and its outcomes. While there is no limit to the length of a notebook, try to make it as compact as possible by removing all unnecessary code. Your audience will be the instructor and your classmates. Please work hard to make the presentation easy to follow. Please cover at least the following topics (preferably in marked sections in this order):
a. The situation, its data, and the questions to be answered
b. Your analysis and the answers to the questions
c. A summary of getting the data and preparing it for analysis
d. A summary of the various obstacles you faced during the project and how you overcame them
Prepare a 20-minute presentation to present to the whole class on the date shown above. You will be using the power point slides for presentation. You will be presenting just the Jupyter notebooks. During the presentation, all group members should present for an equal amount of time.
